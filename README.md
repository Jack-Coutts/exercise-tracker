## 🟢 How This Works (The "Privacy First" Way)
Most apps store your personal information on their own computers (the "Cloud"). **This app does not.** Instead, your data stays in a single file on **your** phone or computer. Think of the web page as a "viewer" and your file as the "digital notebook."

### What is a CSV file?
CSV stands for "Comma Separated Values." It is a simple text file that looks like a spreadsheet. You can open it with Excel, Google Sheets, or even a basic Notepad. In this app, it acts as your **Personal Database**.

## 🚀 Quick Start Guide

### 1. Get the Example File
If you want to see how the app looks with data already in it:
1. Find the file named `example.csv` in the list of files above.
2. Click on it.
3. Click the **Download** icon (it looks like an arrow pointing down) to save it to your device.

### 2. How to use the app every day
Because the app doesn't "remember" you (for privacy), you follow this simple 3-step cycle:

1. **OPEN & UPLOAD:** Open the [Tracker Link](https://anon-anon-111.github.io/exercise-tracker/) and tap the "Import" box. Select your `exercises.csv` file. Your history and maps will instantly appear.
2. **LOG:** Add your new workout for today (type, minutes, and any notes).
3. **SAVE & DOWNLOAD:** This is the most important step! Tap **"Export CSV"**. This saves a *new* version of your file to your device. You can delete the old one.

**If you close the page without clicking "Export," your new entries will not be saved.**

## 📱 Using it on your Phone
You can make this feel like a real app by adding it to your home screen:

**On iPhone (Safari):**
1. Tap the **Square with an Up Arrow** at the bottom of the screen.
2. Scroll down and tap **"Add to Home Screen"**.

**On Android (Chrome):**
1. Tap the **Three Dots** in the top right corner.
2. Tap **"Install App"** or **"Add to Home Screen"**.

## 💡 Pro Tips
* **No Internet Needed:** Once you open the page, you can actually use it at the gym without a signal. Just remember to download the file before you close the tab!
* **Printing:** Use the **Print PDF** button to create a clean, report of your month or year—perfect for showing a trainer or keeping a physical log.
* **Editing:** If you make a mistake, you can always open your CSV file in Excel, fix the numbers, save it, and upload it back to the app.
